proto 1 and 2 are just redundant
Seoul - 21985.mp4 is an example video that i am going to demonstrate on
this video runs at ~30FPS realtime, for slightly over 14 seconds

extract 1 is the folder that stores the extracted frames
extract 2 is another folder to store seperate misc images for manual comparision

target1-p1 shows image extraction in  live accompanying a video feed
target1-p2 directly extracts into folder, no live footage to show each frame

note:there are 426 frames in the video, if you want to keep all frames from target1-p2, it will exceed 600 MB
